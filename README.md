Problem Statement:
People express feelings with words, but at times words don't really capture emotions well. This project translates simple mood words like 'happy','sad'into emojis and messages.

Objectives:
- Convert user's mood into an emoji.
- Display a positive message for each of the moods.
- Log the mood with a timestamp
- Show past mood history

Design and Implementation:
- Python (Google Colab)
- Libraries (Datetime, random, os)

Key concepts used:
- Dictionaries → mood → emoji mapping
- Lists → messages
- Loops and functions for the design

How to run:
1) Open notebook in Colab
2) Run all cells
3) From the menu:
   - Choose 1 → Translate a mood  
   - Choose 2 → Show mood history  
   - Choose 3 → Read project info  
   - Choose 4 → Exit

- Understood Github workflow and documentation

Academic Integrity Statement:
We declare this project is genuine and made by ourselves without the use of any generative AI tools

Conclusion:
This project is a simple yet creative program associating emotions with emojis and messages, while demonstrating core python concepts at the same time.
